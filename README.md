my-vault
========

Automated backup of directories to a vault 'Ã  la Time Machine' with less features and less restrictions for Linux.

Features:
- easy restoring a directory from the vault to its original location;
- all previous versions of a file are kept;
- automatic purging of old versions (freshness is configurable);
- lacks nice GUI for selecting previous versions of file, yet.
